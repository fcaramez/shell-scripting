# Guidelines to install and run these Scripts globally:
* I'm using z-shell (zsh)
* Create a directory in your root folder (~), example:
mkdir ~/bin
This is where you will store all of your scripts
* Go to your zshrc (type "code ./.zshrc in your root folder")
* Add the following command: "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin" (note that /bin should be the name of the folder you created)
* Start creating some scripts on that folder and when you're done, just type the name of the script anywhere on your teminal!
